# FirstProjects
This repository contains a collection of Java programs that I created while taking a course on Java programming. 
The code covers a range of topics including data types, control structures, arrays, functions, and object-oriented programming. 
This code is useful for anyone who is interested in learning Java programming or looking to brush up on their skills.
